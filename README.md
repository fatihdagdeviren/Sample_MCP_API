Sample MCP API
===============

📌 Project Overview

Sample MCP API is a scalable, extendable, and maintainable API solution designed for Modular Code Processing (MCP) systems. Built on top of FastAPI, it provides a solid foundation for developing microservice architectures with modular design patterns.

The project is enhanced with dependency injection, code analysis tools, and customizable modules to support enterprise-grade applications.
